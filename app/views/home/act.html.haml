%h1 Act

%p Synthetic biology is at the verge of a virtual overflow in sequence characterization and their availability for use in rationally designed genetic function. These designed genetic constructs, when inserted in a chassis such as E. coli (a bacteria) or S. cerevisiae (a yeast), impart desired function to the organism. While there will be a definite overabundance in the characterization of genetic material, there are as yet no formalisms in place to uniformly capture all that functional information to be used by computational tools. Without a formal way of encapsulating that information the characterization data will remain computer-inaccessible and only available in human-readable tables and data sheets. Thus, design methodology will remain outside the purview of computational tools.

%p Act formalizes biochemistry using well-understood computational means. It is a formalism for describing the molecular function of species. A specie is any entity that participates in a biochemical reaction. A genetic feature is a specific specie that encodes for and functions either a protein, a RNA, or in its DNA form itself. The central concept of Act is that of a family, akin to the Gene Ontology (GO) concept of a family. In contrast to GO, however, the defining feature of Act families is not their location in the hierarchy of families, but the functional traits corresponding to a specie. In fact, in Act we do not even pre-specify the hierarchy, which can be inferred from containment of functional traits. As such, Act does not simply label families, but rather it provides a formal description of the species' chemical behavior according to a controlled vocabulary to support querying, synthesis, and verification.

%p Every Act species is assigned a family, possibly more than one. An Act family encapsulates a unit of functional char- acteristic, e.g., the enzyme activity of a protein. The formal representation of a family is in terms of a finite state trans- ducer, specifically a Mealy Machine. The states corre- spond to states of existence of the species, e.g., native form, or bound to a small molecule etc. The input and output alphabet is the same and consist of the universe of species.
